Hi, I am Zhiwen Shi, you can call me Clark.

# [Project Portfolio for Data Analyst](./Portfolio.html)

These projects are done along with my data science learning path. Writing in both R and Python.

All the projects in R is exported as HTML, which can be accessed directly from the link.

For Python, I used Jyputer, therefore these files need to be downloaded to view.

# [GSoC 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

Below are the projects I am currently doing:

## [FURY](https://fury.gl)

Free Unified Rendering in Python

A software library for scientific visualization in Python

### **Scientific axes for FURY**

The ability to effectively display scientific data requires a correspondence between the actual and displayed scales and the use of axes to indicate such scales. Many visualization frameworks, such as d3 and Matplotlib, include a variety of ways to generate axes and frames based on the domain of the plotted data. In 3D, axes can be represented by lines or grid planes, and more work is needed to make them practical (such as displaying shadows or lines perpendicular to the grid planes).

![project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9929496/219376799-1da975ad-5b8c-4a43-b681-93c5bcfa1277.png)

This project aims to implement a comprehensive set of actors to display dynamic scientific axes, both in 2D and 3D. This includes the development of a user-friendly API for defining ranges, linear and non-linear transformations, and customizing axes with colors, widths, labels, ticks, and more. Additionally, the project will implement high-quality 3D grids with support for shadows and orthogonal lines, as well as 2D axes, with improved heuristics for distributing labels and ticks. The axes will be animatedly through the keyframe animation API, allowing for interpolation between changes. The implementation of these features will significantly enhance the ability of FURY to produce high-quality scientific visualizations that accurately communicate data to the intended audience.

## [d-SEAMS](https://docs.dseams.info/)

![d-SEAMS](https://python-gsoc.org/logos/254_254_dseams.png)

Deferred Structural Elucidation Analysis for Molecular Simulations.

An organization centered around growing the molecular dynamics post processing toolkit called d-SEAMS

Open Source https://github.com/d-SEAMS/seams-core

**Overview**

d-SEAMS is an engine meant to interface with molecular dynamics trajectories. Like those generated by LAMMPS, the primary software of choice for most d-SEAMS users. As a post-processing tool, for gaining insights into the dynamics systems simulated, it is often best to reduce the gap between trajectories and data. To this end, the current design of d-SEAMS is controlled by a YAML file per analysis, along with a scripting engine, which is currently in Lua. This scripting engine is flexible, and prevents erroneous mixing of unsupported code for the most part, however, Lua is not necessarily well known to most practicing scientists. To this end, the scripting engine will be replaced with a Python embedded interpreter. Rather than writing Python-C code directly to manage the interface, we plan to use the the Pybind11 project.

### **Connecting to the Python Molecular Dynamics community**

Workflows have taken over the high-performance computing landscape, for example, those executed within Jupyter (e.g. PyIron) or without (e.g. AiiDA). These tools often have sophisticated or baroque object relation management models (e.g. PostGreSQL in AiiDA). However, they all also provide an interface through Python.

The goal of this project is to integrate through Pybind11 to these external codes namely:

- `cclib` for transforming data and inputs from different code-bases
- `ase` for integrating with user-designed rapid prototyping tools, e.g. we would like to be able to integrate seamlessly with the existing `ase` toolset, to (e.g.) run an NEB (nudged-elastic-band) and also track the shapes during the process
- `i-pi` which can run additional dynamical simulations (in Python)

A stretch goal here is to convert the internal data structures to an SQL data-base for better integration with AiiDA, however this will need more design inputs.
