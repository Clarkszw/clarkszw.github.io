Welcome to my data science portfolio page where showcases a collection of my projects on Python and R programming, machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and visualization. In this portfolio, I have worked on various datasets ranging from predicting forest fires and heart disease, to building a spam filter and analyzing New York City school data. The goal is to share my passion for data science and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. Each project demonstrates a different aspect of data science and I hope they inspire you to explore the endless possibilities of this field.
