knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
The shortcut to knit a document is Command + Shift + K

## Text Formatting Basics
### Headers

`# First Level Header`

`## Second Level Header`

`### Third Level Header`*** 

### Bulleted and Numbered Lists

* List element 1
* List element 2
* List element 3
    * List item 3a
    * List item 3b
 
numbered lists:

1. Numbered list 1
1. Numbered list 2
1. Numbered list 3.The numbers auto-increment, don’t have to worry about renumbering!

combine numbered and unordered lists:

1. Numbered list 1
1. Numbered list 2
    * Item 1
    * Item 2

### Text Formatting 

* Make text italic like *this* or _this_.
* Make text bold like **this** or __this__.
* Use `backticks` for code.
* Wrap a character to subscript in tildes (`~`). For example, `H~2~O` renders as H~2~O.
* Wrap a character to superscript in carets (`^`), like this: `R^2^` renders as R^2^.

### Insert a new code chunk with:

Command + Option + I 

Before running code chunks it is often a good idea to restart your R session and start with a clean environment. Do this with Command + Shift + F10 

To save time, it’s worth learning these shortcuts to run code:

* Run all chunks above the current chunk with Command + Option + P 
* Run the current chunk with Command + Option + C or Command + Shift + Enter
* Run the next chunk with Command + Option + N 
* Run all chunks with Command + Option + R or Command + A + Enter

### chunk options

* echo = FALSE: Do not show code in the output, but run code and produce all outputs, plots, warnings and messages. The code chunk to generate a plot in the image below is an example of this.
* eval = FALSE: Show code, but do not evaluate it.
* fig.show = "hide": Hide plots.
* include = FALSE: Run code, but suppress all output. This is helpful for setup code. You can see an example of this in the top code chunk of the image below.
* message = FALSE: Prevent packages from printing messages when they load. This also suppress messages generated by functions.
* results = "hide": Hides printed output.
* warning = FALSE: Prevents packages and functions from displaying warnings.

## Inline Code

The `cars` dataset contains `r nrow(cars)` rows and `r ncol(cars)` columns.

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(head(cars), 
             caption = "The First Few Rows of the Cars Dataset")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
