First Data analysis project in R.

Which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?



```{r main}
library(tidyverse)
covid19 <- read.csv('covid19.csv')
covid19_all <- filter(covid19,Province_State == 'All States')
highest_case_positive_rate <- covid19_all %>%
                group_by(Country_Region) %>% 
                summarize(sum_positive = sum(daily_positive),
                          sum_test= sum(daily_tested),
                          rate = sum_positive/sum_test
                          )
sorted <- arrange (highest_case_positive_rate,-rate)
top3 <- head(sorted, 3)
question <- "Which countries have had the highest number of positive cases against the number of tests?"
answer <- top3 %>% pull(Country_Region)
#top3_name <- top3 %>% pull(Country_Region)
#answer <- c("Positive against tested Top3" = top3_name)
covid_analysis_list <- list(question, answer, highest_case_positive_rate)
covid_analysis_list[2]
```

## Positive top rate


```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data=top3,
      x=Country_Region,
      y=rate)
```
